    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Bicol Express is a creamy stew that combines spice and sweetness in a well-balanced manner. The dish makes use of
        ginger and local seasonings resulting in a flavorful combination of meat and sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pork belly – This cut is used in the recipe due to its fat content, which helps keep the meat moist. Other
            cuts of pork, such as kasim or pork shoulder, can also be used as alternatives.</li>
        <li>Coconut milk – This essential ingredient can be fresh, canned, or powdered based on availability.</li>
        <li>Coconut cream – This ingredient is incorporated towards the final stages of the cooking process to enhance
            the sauce’s depth and richness.</li>
        <li>Garlic – Crushed, chopped, or minced. This helps build the basic flavor of the dish.</li>
        <li>Shrimp paste (bagoong alamang) – The main flavor source. Fresh or cooked bagoong can be used. Balao, a
            Filipino fermented shrimp condiment made by mixing small shrimp with salt and rice, then fermenting, is also
            an option.</li>
        <li>Thai chili pepper – A hot chili pepper, 10 times spicier than Jalapeno. Siling Labuyo or bird’s eye chili
            pepper works well for this recipe too.</li>
        <li>Ginger – Crushed or minced, this contributes to the foundational flavors of the dish.</li>
        <li>Onions – Enhance the depth of flavor in Bicol Express. Any variety is suitable.</li>
        <li>Serrano pepper – long green peppers are great. Siling pansigang works well too.</li>
        <li>Maggi Magic Sarap – This enhances the inherent flavors of the ingredients in the recipe while introducing
            umami to the dish.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Cook Adobo</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Combine the ingredients together – Get ready to make the creamiest pork dish with a bit of a kick! Start by
            taking out your pan. Proceed by combining minced ginger, crushed garlic, chopped onion, sliced pork, chopped
            chili pepper, and coconut milk. Mix everything together before turning-on the heat.</li>
        <li>Simmer until the pork tenderizes – Turn on the heat and let it boil. Once the mixture boils, simmer it for
            around 50 minutes. You may add a cup of coconut cream and half of the bagoong alamang after this. Let the
            mixture cook using low heat until it reduces to a quarter.</li>
        <li>Add coconut cream and chili peppers – Afterwards, we will add the rest of the coconut cream and adjust the
            flavor by adding more bagoong if necessary. Also add the Serrano peppers or long green pepper. Continue
            cooking in low heat until the sauce thickens. Add coconut cream and chili peppers – Afterwards, we will add

        <li>Serve! – Make sure to serve this nice and hot, and you now have enough Bicol Express for 6! Also try serving
            it the traditional manner– with some steaming, white rice.</li>
